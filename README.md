OwnTracks Recorder has been installed with a default configuration.
You can make changes to the configuration by editing and then
launching:

    /usr/local/etc/ot-recorder.sh			on Intel Macs and
    /opt/homebrew/etc/ot-recorder.sh			on Apple Silicon Macs

There is also a file with configuration settings in ETCDIR/default/ot-recorder
